Introduction

The LAB-X2 is a platform for experimenting with PIC(R) microcontroller (MCU)
applications.  It contains the circuitry required by the PIC MCU to operate:
5-volt power supply, oscillator, reset circuit, as well as additional
application circuits including LEDs, switches, a potentiometer, an RC servo
connector and an RS232 interface.  A small prototyping area is also included
in case we missed your favorite circuit.

The LAB-X2 can run programs written in assembler, C and PICBASIC(TM) or
PICBASIC PRO(TM).  It include an in-circuit programming connector so the
resident PIC MCU may be reprogrammed on the fly (requires flash device) using
programmers that support this feature like the EPIC(TM) Programmer and melabs
Serial Programmer.

All of the PIC MCU I/O pins are brought out to a header socket at the bottom
edge of the LAB-X2.  This allows connection to an off-board breadboard so
that other circuits can be added.

The LAB-X2 is designed to work with 28- and 40-pin PIC MCUs.  It is available
in either assembled or bare-board form.  A parts list and schematic, along
with PICBASIC and PICBASIC PRO example programs, are included.  It has the
following features:

28-pin socket for PIC(R) MCU
40-pin socket for PIC(R) MCU
5-volt regulator
4MHz oscillator
3 LEDs plus power LED
3 pushbutton switches plus reset button
Potentiometer
RC servo connector
RS232 interface
EPIC(TM) in-circuit programming connector
Prototyping area for additional circuits
Header socket for connection to breadboard

A parts list and assembly instructions, along with a PIC MCU pin
connection list, are found towards the end of this document.

Each of the circuits on the LAB-X2 are described below.  Refer to the
schematic and sample programs on the disk for additional information.

It is recommended that you start with a simple program like BLINKX2.BAS to
get familiar with the operation and programming of the LAB-X2.


Power Supply

The power supply section provides regulated +5 volts DC for use by the LAB-X2
components.  An AC adapter that provides between +7.5 and +16 volts DC is
recommended to power the LAB-X2 through J2.  The center pin on the connector
is positive.

The regulator will get quite warm.  It may be desirable to attach a heat sink
to it at higher input voltages.

There is no power switch.  The AC adapter should be unplugged when the LAB-X2
is not in use.


Processor

The LAB-X2 includes 28- and 40-pin sockets to support a 28- or 40-pin PIC
MCU.  A PIC16F876 or PIC16F877 is recommended where available.These flash
devices may be reprogrammed in-circuit using the EPIC or melabs Serial
Programmer.  Alternatively, a PIC16C76, PIC16C77 or other 28- or 40-pin PIC
MCU may be used.  These non-flash devices would need to be removed from the
socket for erasing but may be programmed on the LAB-X2 board using the
in-circuit connector and an EPIC or melabs Serial Programmer.

The PIC MCU must be inserted with pin 1 at the notch end of the socket on the
LAB-X2 board.

The LAB-X2 must be powered-up in order to program a PIC MCU on it.

A reset button is provided to restart a running program.  It should not be
pressed during device programming.

Header socket J1 allows connections to external circuits on a solderless or
other breadboard.


Oscillator

The LAB-X2 includes a 4MHz oscillator that provides the clock source to the
PIC MCU.


ICSP

The PIC MCU in the LAB-X2 28- or 40-pin socket may be programmed in-circuit
using an EPIC or melabs Serial Programmer.  A short 10-pin cable should be
attached between connector J3 on the programmer and J3 on the LAB-X2 (pin 1
is located on the lower left of J3 on the LAB-X2).  The programmer software
should be started and the proper device selected.  The LAB-X2 must be powered
up during programming.  The PIC MCU may now be programmed in-circuit on the
LAB-X2.

If the PIC MCU is a flash device, it may be reprogrammed without being
removed.  If it is a windowed EPROM (JW) device, it must be removed from the
LAB-X2 to be UV erased before reprogramming.  An OTP device cannot be erased.


LEDs

3 programmable LEDs are connected to PORTB.0 - 2.  There is also 1 power LED
that is always on when power is applied to the LAB-X2.  Resistors R4 - 7 are
the current limit series resistors for the LEDs.  To make an LED light up, set
the appropriate PORTB pin to output high.

See BLINKX2.BAS and BLINK3X2.BAS for programming examples.


Pushbutton Switches

3 push button switches are connected to pins PORTB.4 - 6 on the PIC MCU.
The PORTB pullups must be enabled before the switches are read:

        OPTION_REG.7 = 0        ' PICBASIC PRO code to enable PORTB pullups

A closed switch will show a 0 and an open switch will show a 1.

See BUTX2.BAS for a programming example.


Potentiometer

The LAB-X2 includes a potentiometer connected to PORTA.0 of the PIC MCU.
This is an analog to digital converter input pin on PIC MCUs that support
this function (such as the 16F876 and 16F877).  Jumper JP2 allows the
potentiometer to be disconnected from the PIC MCU pin when the pin is to
be used for another purpose.  Make sure the jumper is in place to use the
potentiometer.

The potentiometer may also be used as a switch by setting the input pin to
digital mode and moving the pot wheel all the way to either the 5-volt or
ground position, providing either a high or low on the input.

See ADCX2.BAS, ADC8X2.BAS and ADC10X2.BAS for programming examples.


RC Servo

Connector J5 may be used to connect an RC servo to the LAB-X2.  Pin 1, at the
bottom of the connector (usually the white wire), is the servo pulse input.
It is connected to PORTB.3.  Pin 2 is +5 volts to the servo (usually the red
wire) and Pin 3 is ground (usually the black wire).

Most RC servos are operated by sending a 1ms to 2ms pulse 50 to 60 times a
second.  The pulse width determines the servo position.  A 1.5ms pulse is the
center.  A 1ms pulse is all the way one direction and a 2ms pulse is all the
way the other direction.

See SERVOX2.BAS for a programming example.


RS232

The LAB-X2 includes an RS232 interface to connector J4.  This allows
asynchronous serial communication with other devices, including PCs.  A
MAX232 IC in socket U2, along with several capacitors, generates the required
RS232 voltages.

The serial TX line (pin 2 on J4) is connected to PORTC.6 through the MAX232.
The serial RX line (pin 3 on J4) is connected to PORTC.7 through the MAX232.
RTS is connected to CTS (pin 7 to pin 8) on J4.  DTR is connected to DCD and
DSR (pin 1 to 4 to 6) on J4.  These jumped connections make most comm
programs think the LAB-X2 is online and ready to communicate.

See HSERX2.BAS for a programming example.

Assembly Instructions

All components must be placed on the top side of the board (the side with the
silk-screened labeling) and soldered from the under side of the board using a
good quality resin-core solder.  While the LAB-X2 is not difficult to
assemble, some experience with assembling previous projects is desirable.

1. Solder in the resistors.

2. Solder in the IC sockets, observing polarity.

3. Solder in the push button switches.

4. Solder in the LEDs, observing polarity.

5. Solder in the headers, header socket and jumpers.

6. Solder in the capacitors, observing polarity where necessary.

7. Solder in the DC power connector.

8. Solder in the DB9S connector.

9. Solder in the 4.000MHz crystal.

10. Solder in the 5-volt regulator, observing polarity (flat heat-sink side
toward bottom of board).

11. Solder in the thumbwheel potentiometer.

12. Place jumper on JP2.

Before proceeding, it is a good idea to check the power supply.  Attach a
suitable DC power source to J2.  Measure for 5 volts between Vdd (pin 32) and
Vss (pin 31) on the 40-pin socket.  If 5 volts is not present, recheck all
your work.

13. Install the MAX232 IC, observing polarity.

14. Stick the rubber feet to each corner of the board.
