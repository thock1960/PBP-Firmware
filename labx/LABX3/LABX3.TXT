Introduction

The LAB-X3 is a platform for experimenting with PIC(R) microcontroller (MCU)
applications.  It contains the circuitry required by the PIC MCU to operate:
5-volt power supply, oscillator, reset circuit, as well as additional
application circuits including switches, a potentiometer, LEDs, LCD module
and an RS232 interface.  A prototyping area is also included in case we
missed your favorite circuit.

Many different projects may be created using the LAB-X3.  Some examples
include a LCD clock, servo controller, LCD backpack and many more.  The
LAB-X3 can run programs written in assembler, C and PICBASIC(TM) or
PICBASIC PRO(TM).  It includes an in-circuit programming connector so the
resident PIC MCU may be reprogrammed on the fly (requires flash device) using
programmers that support this feature like the EPIC(TM) Programmer or melabs
Serial Programmer.

All of the PIC MCU I/O pins are brought out to a header.  This allows
connection to off-board circuits.

The LAB-X3 is available in either assembled or bare-board form.  A parts list
and schematic, along with PICBASIC and PICBASIC PRO example programs, are
included.  It has the following features:

18-pin dip socket for PIC(R) MCU
5-volt regulator
4MHz oscillator
Reset button
Push button
Potentiometer
2 LEDs plus power LED
2 line by 20 character LCD module
RC servo connector
RS232 interface
EPIC(TM) in-circuit programming connector
Prototyping area for additional circuits

A parts list and assembly instructions, along with a PIC MCU pin
connection list, are found towards the end of this document.

Each of the circuits on the LAB-X3 are described below.  Refer to the
schematic and sample programs on the disk for additional information.  It is
also a good idea to have the data sheets available for each of the devices
used on the LAB-X3.  These data sheets can usually be found on the
manufacturers web site.

It is recommended that you start with a simple program like BLINKX3.BAS to
get familiar with the operation and programming of the LAB-X3.


Power Supply

The power supply section provides regulated +5 volts DC for use by the LAB-X3
components.  An AC adapter that provides between +7.5 and +16 volts DC is
recommended to power the LAB-X3 through J2.  The center pin on the connector
is positive.

The regulator will get quite warm.  It may be desirable to attach a heat sink
to it at higher input voltages.

There is no power switch.  The AC adapter should be unplugged when the LAB-X3
is not in use.


Processor

The LAB-X3 includes an 18-pin dip socket to support an 18-pin PIC MCU.
A PIC16F84 or PIC16F628 is recommended where available.  These flash devices
may be reprogrammed in-circuit using the EPIC or melabs Serial Programmer.
Alternatively, other 18-pin PIC MCUs may be used.  These devices may need to
be removed from the socket for erasing but may be programmed on the LAB-X3
board using the in-circuit connector and an EPIC or melabs Serial Programmer.

The PIC MCU must be placed in the socket with pin 1 toward the left, bottom
of the LAB-X3 board.

The LAB-X3 must be powered-up in order to program a PIC MCU in the 18-pin
dip socket.

A reset button, S2, is provided to restart a running program.

Header J4 may be added to the LAB-X3 below the 18-pin dip socket.  This
allows connections to external circuits.


Oscillator

The LAB-X3 includes a 4MHz oscillator that provides the clock source to the
PIC MCU.


ICSP

The PIC MCU in the LAB-X3 18-pin socket may be programmed in-circuit using an
EPIC or melabs Serial Programmer.  A short 10-pin cable should be attached
between connector J3 on the programmer and J3 on the LAB-X3 (pin 1 is located
on the lower right of J3 on the LAB-X3).  The programmer software should be
started and the proper device selected. The PIC MCU should then be placed
into the 18-pin socket on the LAB-X3.  The LAB-X3 must be powered up during
programming.  The PIC MCU may now be programmed in-circuit on the LAB-X3.

If the PIC MCU is a flash device, it may be reprogrammed without being
removed.  If it is a windowed EPROM (JW) device, it must be removed from the
LAB-X3 to be UV erased before reprogramming.  An OTP device cannot be erased.

Neither button should be pressed during device programming.


Potentiometer

The LAB-X3 includes a potentiometer connected to PORTB.0, along with a
capacitor.  This allows the potentiometer to be read using the PICBASIC and
PICBASIC PRO Compiler POT command.

The PORTB pullup resistors must be disabled to read the potentiometer
reliably:

        OPTION_REG.7 = 1        ' PICBASIC PRO code to disable PORTB pullups

See POTX3.BAS for a programming example.


Pushbutton Switches

Two push button switches are available on the LAB-X3.  S1 is connected to pin
PORTB.7 on the PIC MCU.  The PORTB pullups must be enabled before this switch
can be read:

        OPTION_REG.7 = 0        ' PICBASIC PRO code to enable PORTB pullups

Push button switch S2 is connected to the master clear (reset) line on the
PIC MCU.  For the PIC16F84 and most other 18-pin PIC MCUs, pressing this
button will cause the PIC MCU to reset.  On PIC16F627 and PIC16F628 and other
MCUs, the reset function of this pin can be disabled and the pin can be used
as an input pin.  See the Microchip data sheet special functions section for
information on this option.

A closed switch will show a 0 and an open switch will show a 1.

See BUTX3.BAS for a programming example.


LEDs

The LAB-X3 includes a power LED that is on any time the power is on, and two
programmable LEDs, LED1 and LED2.  Each LED includes a 470 ohm series
resistor.

To turn on LED1, set pin PORTB.4 to output high.  To turn on LED2, set pin
PORTB.5 to output high.

See BLINKX3.BAS for a programming example.


LCD Module

A 20 character by 2 line LCD module is included on the LAB-X3.  It may be
used to display all manner of text information.  The module includes a
Hitachi 44780 (or equivalent) controller.  It is accessed using a 4-bit data
bus along with register select and enable lines.

The LCD data bus is connected to PORTA.0 - 3 of the PIC MCU.  The register
select line is connected to PORTA.4, along with a pullup resistor.  Enable is
connected to PORTB.3.  The read/write line is connected to ground to select
write at all times.

On PIC MCUs with analog to digital converters or analog comparators, PORTA
will start up in analog mode.  PORTA must be set to digital mode for the LCD
to operate properly:

     CMCON = 7

or

     ADCON1 = 7

The LCD contrast is set with a single resistor to ground, R2.  Another
resistor, R8, may be used to power an LCD backlight through connector J7.
The supplied LCD module does not include a backlight.

See LCDX3.BAS for a programming example.


RC Servo

Connector J5 may be used to connect an RC servo to LAB-X3.  Pin 1, all the
way to the left on the connector (usually the white wire), is the servo
pulse input.  It is connected to PORTB.6.  Pin 2 is +5 volts to the servo
(usually the red wire) and pin 3 on the connector is ground (usually the
black wire).

Most RC servos are operated by sending a 1ms to 2ms pulse 50 to 60 times a
second.  The pulse width determines the servo position.  A 1.5ms pulse is the
center.  A 1ms pulse is all the way one direction and a 2ms pulse is all the
way the other direction.

See SERVOX3.BAS for a programming example.


RS232

The LAB-X3 includes an RS232 interface to connector J6.  This allows
asynchronous serial communication with other devices, including PCs.  A
MAX232 IC in socket U2, along with several capacitors, generates the required
RS232 voltages.

The serial TX line (pin 2 on J6) is connected to PORTB.2 through the MAX232. 
The serial RX line (pin 3 on J6) is connected to PORTB.1 through the MAX232. 
RTS is connected to CTS (pin 7 to pin 8) on J6.  DTR is connected to DCD and
DSR (pin 1 to 4 to 6) on J6.  These jumped connections make most comm
programs think the LAB-X3 is online and ready to communicate.

See HSERX3.BAS for a programming example.

Assembly Instructions

All components must be placed on the top side of the board (the side with the
silk-screened labeling) and soldered from the under side of the board using a
good quality resin-core solder.  While the LAB-X3 is not difficult to
assemble, some experience with assembling previous projects is desirable.

1. Solder in the resistors.

2. Solder in the IC sockets, observing polarity.

3. Solder in the push button switches.

4. Solder in the LEDs, observing polarity.

5. Solder in the capacitors, observing polarity where necessary.

6. Solder in the headers, including J1 for the LCD module.

7. Solder in the DC power connector, DB9S connector and 4.000MHz crystal.

8. Solder in the 5-volt regulator, observing polarity (flat heat-sink side
toward board).

9. Solder in the thumbwheel potentiometer.

Before proceeding, it is a good idea to check the power supply.  Attach a
suitable DC power source to J2.  Measure for 5 volts between Vdd, pin 11, and
Vss, pin 5, on U1.  If 5 volts is not present, recheck all your work.

10. Place the double-sided foam tape onto the back of the LCD module.  Slide
the LCD module, face up, onto the LCD header, J1, and solder into place from
the top side of the LCD.

11. Install the MAX232 IC, observing polarity.

12. Stick the rubber feet to each corner of the board.



Test Program

A test program, TESTX3.BAS, has been included to provide a quick operational
test of the LAB-X3.  It must be programmed into an appropriate device and the
LAB-X3 powered up.

The top line of the LCD will display the potentiometer value.  If pins 2 and
3 are jumped on the RS232 connector, J6, the second line of the LCD will
display the word "loopback".  When push button S1 is pressed, LED1 will light
up.  When push button S2 is pressed, LED2 will light.
