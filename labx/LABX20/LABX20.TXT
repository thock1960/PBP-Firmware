Introduction

The LAB-X20 is a platform for experimenting with PIC(R) microcontroller (MCU)
applications.  It contains the circuitry required by the PIC MCU to operate:
5-volt power supply, oscillator, reset circuit, as well as additional
application circuits including switches, a potentiometer, LEDs, LCD module,
serial EEPROM socket and an RS232 interface.  A prototyping area is also
included in case we missed your favorite circuit.

Many different projects may be created using the LAB-X20.  Some examples
include a LCD clock, servo controller, LCD backpack and many more.  The
LAB-X20 can run programs written in assembler, C and PICBASIC(TM) or
PICBASIC PRO(TM).  It includes an in-circuit programming connector so the
resident PIC MCU may be reprogrammed on the fly (requires flash device)
using programmers that support this feature like the EPIC(TM) Programmer and
the melabs Serial Programmer.

All of the PIC MCU I/O pins are brought out to a header.  This allows
connection to off-board circuits.

The LAB-X20 is available in either assembled or bare-board form.  A parts
list and schematic, along with PICBASIC and PICBASIC PRO example programs,
are included.  It has the following features:

20-pin dip socket for PIC(R) MCU
5-volt regulator
3 push buttons (one may be used for reset)
Potentiometer
2 LEDs plus power LED
2 line by 20 character LCD module
Socket for I2C serial EEPROM
RS232 interface
EPIC(TM) in-circuit programming connector
Layout for oscillator
Prototyping area for additional circuits

A parts list and assembly instructions, along with a PIC MCU pin
connection list, are found toward the end of this document.

Each of the circuits on the LAB-X20 are described below.  Refer to the
schematic and sample programs on the disk for additional information.  It is
also a good idea to have the data sheets available for each of the devices
used on the LAB-X20.  These data sheets can usually be found on the
manufacturers web site.

It is recommended that you start with a simple program like BLINKX20.BAS to
get familiar with the operation and programming of the LAB-X20.


Power Supply

The power supply section provides regulated +5 volts DC for use by the LAB-X20
components.  An AC adapter that provides between +7.5 and +16 volts DC is
recommended to power the LAB-X20 through J2.  The center pin on the connector
is positive.

The regulator will get quite warm.  It may be desirable to attach a heat sink
to it at higher input voltages.

There is no power switch.  The AC adapter should be unplugged when the LAB-X20
is not in use.


Processor

The LAB-X20 includes a 20-pin dip socket to support an 8-, 14- or 20-pin
PIC MCU.  A PIC12F683, PIC16F688 or PIC16F690 is recommended where available.
These flash devices may be reprogrammed in-circuit using the EPIC Programmer
or melabs Serial Programmer.  Alternatively, other 8-, 14- or 20-pin PIC
MCUs may be used.  These devices may need to be removed from the socket for
erasing but may be programmed on the LAB-X4 board using the in-circuit
connector with an EPIC Programmer or melabs Serial Programmer.

Depending on the processor used, the first port on it may be referred to by
several names: GPIO, PORTA or PORTB.  This document and schematic will use
the name PORTA.  The appropriate name for the specific device must be used
in the program.

The PIC MCU must be placed in the socket with pin 1 toward the left, bottom
of the LAB-X20 board.

The LAB-X20 must be powered-up in order to program a PIC MCU in the 20-pin
dip socket.

A reset button is provided to restart a running program.  The pin connected
to this button may also be configured to act as a general purpose input pin
instead of a reset pin, though this is not recommended when using in-circuit
programming to reprogram the device.

Header J4 may be added to the LAB-X20 below the 20-pin dip socket.  This
allows connections to external circuits.


Oscillator

The LAB-X20 includes traces for an external oscillator (not included) that
can provide the clock source to the PIC MCU.  Most 8-, 14- and 20-pin PIC
MCUs have an on-chip oscillator that is usually used.  An external crystal
and capacitors or a ceramic resonator may be added if more accuracy is
required than the internal oscillator can provide.

LED1 and LED2 are normally connected to these oscillator pins.  If an
external oscillator is desired, the LEDs must be disconnected by cutting the
traces on the back of the board under JP2 and JP3.


ICSP

The PIC MCU in the LAB-X20 20-pin socket may be programmed in-circuit using
an EPIC Programmer or melabs Serial Programmer.  A short 10-pin cable should
be attached between connector J3 on the programmer header and J3 on the
LAB-X20 (pin 1 is located on the lower right of J3 on the LAB-X20).  The
programmer software should be started and the proper device selected. The
PIC MCU should then be placed into the 20-pin socket on the LAB-X20.
The LAB-X20 must be powered up during programming.  The PIC MCU may now be
programmed in-circuit on the LAB-X20.

If the PIC MCU is a flash device, it may be reprogrammed without being
removed.  If it is a windowed EPROM (JW) device, it must be removed from the
LAB-X20 to be UV erased before reprogramming.  An OTP device cannot be erased.

None of the buttons should be pressed during device programming.


Analog / Digital pins

PIC MCU pins with analog to digital converters or analog comparators will
start up in analog mode.  They must be set to digital mode for the many
functions, including the LCD to operate properly:

	ANSEL = 0	' PICBASIC PRO commands to set all pins to digital
	ANSELH = 0


Potentiometer

The LAB-X20 includes a potentiometer connected to PORTA.2.  The potentiometer
can be read using the PICBASIC PRO Compiler's ADCIN command.

The potentiometer may be disconnected from the PIC MCU by cutting the trace
on the back of the board under JP4.

The potentiometer may also be used as a switch by setting the input pin to
digital mode and moving the pot wheel all the way to either the 5-volt or
ground position, providing either a high or low on the input.

See POTX20.BAS for a programming example.


Pushbutton Switches

Three push button switches are available on the LAB-X20.  The switch labeled
RESET is connected to pin PORTA.3 on the PIC MCU, along with a pullup
resistor.  This pin can be configured as either a general purpose input pin
or as a reset pin.  It is recommended this pin be configured as a reset pin
when the MCU is programmed in-circuit.  See the Microchip data sheet special
functions section for information on this option.

Switch SW1 is connected to PORTA.0 and SW2 is connected to PORTA.1.  The
internal pullups for these pins must be enabled before the switches can be
read:

	OPTION_REG.7 = 0	' PICBASIC PRO command to enable internal pullups

A closed switch will read as 0 and an open switch will read as 1.

None of the buttons should be pressed during device programming.

See BUTX20.BAS for a programming example.


LEDs

The LAB-X20 includes a power LED that is on any time the power is on, and two
programmable LEDs, LED1 and LED2.  Each LED includes a 470 ohm series
resistor.

To turn on LED1, set pin PORTA.0 to output high.  To turn on LED2, set pin
PORTA.1 to output high.

LED1 and LED2 are also connected to these oscillator pins.  If adding an
external oscillator is desired, the LEDs must be disconnected by cutting the
traces on the back of the board under JP2 and JP3.

See BLINKX20.BAS for a programming example.


LCD Module

A 20 character by 2 line LCD module is included on the LAB-X20.  It may be
used to display all manner of text information.  The module includes a
Hitachi 44780 (or equivalent) controller.  It is accessed using a 4-bit data
bus along with register select and enable lines.

The LCD data bus is connected to PORTC.0 - 3 of the PIC MCU.  The register
select line is connected to PORTC.4.  Enable is connected to PORTC.5.  The
read/write line is connected to ground to select write at all times.

The LCD contrast is set with a single resistor to ground, R6.  Another
resistor, R9, may be used to power an LCD backlight through connector J6.
The supplied LCD module does not include a backlight.

See LCDX20.BAS for a programming example.


I2C Serial EEPROM

The LAB-X20 includes a socket for an I2C serial EEPROM.  The I2C serial
data (SDA) line is connected to PIC MCU pin PORTB.4.  The serial
clock (SCL) line is connected to PORTB.6.  A 20-pin PIC MCU is required to
use these connections.

The serial clock and data lines are connected to 4.7k pull-up resistors R7
and R8.

See I2CX20.BAS for a programming example.

Some of the possible I2C serial EEPROMs that may be used are:

Device		Architecture		Digi-Key Part Number
24LC01B		1K (128 x 8)		24LC01B/P-ND
24LC02B		2K (256 x 8)		24LC02B/P/ND
24LC04B		4K (2 x 256 x 8)	24LC04B/P-ND
24LC08B		8K (4 x 256 x 8)	24LC08B/P-ND
24LC16B		16K (8 x 256 x 8)	24LC16B/P-ND
24LC32A		32K (4K x 8)		24LC32B/P-ND
24LC256		256K (32K x 8)		24LC256-I/P-ND


RS232

The LAB-X20 includes an RS232 interface to connector J5.  This allows
asynchronous serial communication with other devices, including PCs.  A
MAX232 IC in socket U2, along with several capacitors, generates the required
RS232 voltages.

The serial TX line (pin 2 on J5) is connected to PORTB.7 through the MAX232. 
The serial RX line (pin 3 on J5) is connected to PORTB.5 through the MAX232. 
A 20-pin PIC MCU is required to use these connections.

RTS is connected to CTS (pin 7 to pin 8) on J5.  DTR is connected to DCD and
DSR (pin 1 to 4 to 6) on J5.  These jumped connections make most comm
programs think the LAB-X20 is online and ready to communicate.

See HSERX20.BAS for a programming example.

Assembly Instructions

All components must be placed on the top side of the board (the side with the
silk-screened labeling) and soldered from the under side of the board using a
good quality resin-core solder.  While the LAB-X20 is not difficult to
assemble, some experience with assembling previous projects is desirable.

1. Solder in the resistors.

2. Solder in the IC sockets, observing polarity.

3. Solder in the push button switches.

4. Solder in the LEDs, observing polarity.

5. Solder in the capacitors, observing polarity where necessary.

6. Solder in the headers, including J1 for the LCD module.

7. Solder in the DC power connector and DB9S connector.

8. Solder in the 5-volt regulator, observing polarity (flat heat-sink side
toward board).

9. Solder in the thumbwheel potentiometer.

Before proceeding, it is a good idea to check the power supply.  Attach a
suitable DC power source to J2.    Measure for 5 volts between +5V and GND
on the pads right below J2.  If 5 volts is not present, recheck all your work.

10. Place the double-sided foam tape onto the back of the LCD module.  Slide
the LCD module, face up, onto the LCD header, J1, and solder into place from
the top side of the LCD.

11. Install the MAX232 IC, observing polarity.



Test Program

A test program, TESTX20.BAS, has been included to provide a quick operational
test of the LAB-X20.  It must be programmed into an appropriate device and the
LAB-X20 powered up.

The top line of the LCD will display the potentiometer value.  If pins 2 and
3 are jumped on the RS232 connector, J5, the second line of the LCD will
display the word "loopback".  When push button SW1 is pressed, LED1 will
light up.  When push button SW2 is pressed, LED2 will light.
