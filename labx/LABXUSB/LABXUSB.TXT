Introduction

The LAB-XUSB is a platform for experimenting with PIC(R) microcontroller
(MCU) applications.  It contains the circuitry required by the PIC(R) MCU
to operate: 5-volt power supply, oscillator, reset circuit, as well as
additional application circuits including switches, potentiometers, LEDs,
LCD module, RS232 interface, USB interface and speaker, among others.
A prototyping area is also included in case we missed your favorite circuit.

Many different projects may be created using the LAB-XUSB.  Some examples
include a calculator, LCD clock, digital thermometer, LCD backpack, data
logger and many more.  All of the PIC MCU I/O pins are brought out to a
header that allows connection to off-board circuits.

The LAB-XUSB can run programs written in assembler, C and PICBASIC(TM) or
PICBASIC PRO(TM).  It includes an in-circuit programming connector so the
resident PIC MCU may be reprogrammed on the fly (requires flash device)
using programmers that support this feature like the EPIC(TM) Programmer
and the melabs Serial Programmer.

The LAB-XUSB is designed to work with 40-pin PIC MCUs and is available in
either assembled or bare-board form.  A parts list and schematic, along with
PICBASIC(TM) and PICBASIC PRO(TM) example programs, are included.  It has
the following features:

40-pin ZIF socket for PIC MCU
5-volt regulator
20MHz oscillator
Reset button
16 switch keypad
2 potentiometers
4 LEDs
2 line by 20 character LCD module
Speaker
RC servo connector
RS232 interface
USB connector
Socket for digital to analog converter (device not included)
Socket for I2C serial EEPROM (device not included)
Socket for Dallas DS1307 real time clock (device not included)
Pads for Dallas DS18S20 temperature sensors (device not included)
EPIC in-circuit programming connector
Prototyping area for additional circuits

A parts list and assembly instructions, along with a PIC MCU pin
connection list, are found towards the end of this document.

Each of the circuits on the LAB-XUSB are described below.  Refer to the
schematic and sample programs on the disk for additional information.  It is
also a good idea to have the data sheets available for each of the devices
used on the LAB-XUSB.  These data sheets can usually be found on the
manufacturers web site.

It is recommended that you start with a simple program like BLINKXU.BAS to
get familiar with the operation and programming of the LAB-XUSB.


Power Supply

5 volt power to run the LAB-XUSB can be supplied by either a USB connection
to a PC or by an on-board regulator and external AC adapter.  Jumper JP2 is
used to select which to use for power.  If pins 1 and 2 (labeled USB) are
jumpered, power will be taken from the USB connector.  If pins 2 and 3
(labeled Ext.) are jumpered, power is taken from an AC adapter via the
on-board regulator.  An AC adapter that provides between +7.5 and +16 volts
DC is recommended to power the LAB-XUSB through J2.  The center pin on the
connector is positive.

The regulator may get quite warm.  It may be desirable to attach a heat sink
to it at higher input voltages.

There is no power switch.  The AC adapter or USB connection should be
unplugged when the LAB-XUSB is not in use.


Processor

The LAB-XUSB includes a 40-pin ZIF socket to support a 40-pin PIC MCU.  A
PIC18F4550 is recommended where available.  This flash device may be
reprogrammed in-circuit using an melabs Programmer.  Other PIC MCUs may also
be used but may not have all the functions necessary to make use of all the
circuits on the LAB-XUSB.

To insert a PIC MCU into the ZIF socket, first lift the lever on the
socket.  The PIC MCU must be placed in the socket with pin 1 to the left
of the LAB-XUSB board.  The lever on the socket should then be lowered.

The LAB-XUSB must be powered-up in order to program a PIC MCU in the 40-pin
ZIF socket.

A reset button is provided to restart a running program.  It should not be
pressed during device programming.

Header J5 may be added to the LAB-XUSB below the 40-pin ZIF socket.  This
allow connections to external circuits.


Oscillator

The LAB-XUSB includes a 20MHz oscillator that provides the clock source to
the PIC MCU.  It is possible to use other crystal values to provide other
clock frequencies.


ICSP

The PIC MCU in the LAB-XUSB 40-pin ZIF socket may be programmed in-circuit
using an melabs Programmer.  A short 10-pin cable should be attached between
connector J3 on the melabs Programmer and J3 on the LAB-XUSB (pin 1 is
located on the lower right of J3 on the LAB-XUSB).  The programmer software
should be started and the proper device selected. The PIC MCU should then be
placed into the 40-pin ZIF socket on the LAB-XUSB.  The LAB-XUSB must be
powered up during programming.  The PIC MCU may now be programmed in-circuit
on the LAB-XUSB.

If the PIC MCU is a flash device, it may be erased and reprogrammed without
removing it from the LAB-XUSB.  If it is a windowed EPROM (JW) device, it
must be removed from the LAB-XUSB to be UV erased before reprogramming.  An
OTP (one time programmable) device cannot be erased.

Two 100k pull-down resistors are included, R11 on PORTB.3 for the PIC16F877
and R12 on PORTB.5 for the PIC18F4550.  These connections to the PGM pin
make sure it is connected to ground for programming purposes.  They should
not affect any other program operation.


USB

The LAB-XUSB includes a USB connector that is connected to D+ and D- on PIC
MCUs that have an on-chip USB peripheral.  These include the low-speed
PIC16C765 and full-speed PIC18F4455 and 4550.  The PIC18F4550 is recommended
to give the best performance and is also flash erasable and reprogrammable.

To use the PIC16C765, a 1.5k resistor must be added at location R5 to signal
the USB bus a low speed device is available.  R5 should remain empty when
using the PIC18F4550.

Some USB example programs are included, such as USBMOUSE.BAS.  Many of
the included sample programs do not use USB as the LAB-XUSB may also be used
with PIC MCUs that do not include the USB peripheral.


Potentiometers

The LAB-XUSB includes 2 potentiometers connected to PORTA.0 and 1.  These
are analog to digital converter input pins on PIC MCUs that support this
function (such as the 18F4550).  The potentiometers may be disconnected from
the PIC MCU by cutting the trace on the back of the board connecting JP7 and
JP8, so that these pins may be used for other functions.

The potentiometers may also be used as switches by setting the input pins to
digital mode and moving the pot wheels all the way to either the 5-volt or
ground position, providing either a high or low on the input.

See ADCIN8XU.BAS for a programming example.


Keypad Switches

16 push button switches are arranged into a 4 by 4 matrix and connected to
the 8 pins of PORTB on the PIC MCU.  The 4 rows are connected to
PORTB.0 - PORTB.3 through 270 ohm series resistors, R13 - R16.  The
resistors isolate the pins so that multiple button pressed don't short them
out.

The 4 columns are connected to PORTB.4 - PORTB.7.  This arrangement allows
any single switch state to be read by the PIC MCU.  The PORTB pullups must
be enabled before the switches are read:

	OPTION_REG.7 = 0	' For PIC16Xxxx

	INTCON2.7 = 0		' For PIC18Xxxxx

The switch states are read by setting one row to ground and making the other
7 PORTB lines inputs.  The 4 columns may then be read to determine which of
the switches in the selected row is closed.  A closed switch will show a 0
in its column position and an open switch will show a 1.  Each of the 4 rows
is scanned in the same manner to determine all of the switch states.
Included sample programs demonstrate this scanning.

See KEYXU.BAS for a programming example.


LEDs

4 programmable LEDs connected to PORTD.0 - PORTD.3 and 1 power LED are
provided.  The programmable LEDs light up when the PIC MCU pin is high.
These LEDs may be effectively disconnected from the PIC MCU, if desired, by
cutting the trace on the back of the board connecting JP4.

See BLINK4XU.BAS for a programming example.


LCD Module

A 20 character by 2 line LCD module is included on the LAB-XUSB.  It may be
used to display all manner of text information.  The module includes a
Hitachi 44780 (or equivalent) controller.  It is accessed using a 4-bit data
bus along with register select, read/write and enable lines.

The LCD data bus is connected to PORTD.4 - PORTD.7 of the PIC MCU.  The
register select line is connected to PORTE.0.  Enable is connected to
PORTE.1.  The read/write line is connected to PORTE.2.  The read/write line
is also pulled down (write mode) with a 1k resistor, R4.

On PIC MCUs with analog to digital converters, PORTE will start up in analog
mode.  PORTE must be set to digital mode for the LCD to operate properly:

	ADCON1 = 15

The LCD contrast is set with a single resistor to ground, R3.  Another
resistor, R6, may be used to power an LCD backlight through connector J6.
The supplied LCD module does not include a backlight.

See LCDXU.BAS for a programming example.


I2C Serial EEPROM

The LAB-XUSB includes a socket for an I2C serial EEPROM.  The I2C serial
data (SDA) line is connected to PIC MCU pin PORTA.4, by default.  The serial
clock (SCL) line is connected to PORTA.5, by default.  Cutting the traces on
the back of the board behind connectors JP5 and JP6 allows connection of the
SDA and SCL lines to alternate pins on the PIC MCU.  Jumpering pins 2 to 3
on each of those connectors moves SDA to PORTB.0 and SCL to PORTB.1.

The serial clock and data lines are connected to 4.7k pull-up resistors R9
and R10.  The I2C lines are also shared with the real time clock, if present.

See I2CXU.BAS for a programming example.

Some of the possible I2C serial EEPROMs that may be used are:

Device		Architecture		Digi-Key Part Number
24LC01B		1K (128 x 8)		24LC01B/P-ND
24LC02B		2K (256 x 8)		24LC02B/P/ND
24LC04B		4K (2 x 256 x 8)	24LC04B/P-ND
24LC08B		8K (4 x 256 x 8)	24LC08B/P-ND
24LC16B		16K (8 x 256 x 8)	24LC16B/P-ND
24LC32A		32K (4K x 8)		24LC32B/P-ND
24LC256		256K (32K x 8)		24LC256-I/P-ND


Speaker

The LAB-XUSB includes a low power piezo speaker in series with a DC blocking
capacitor.  This allows the program to generate sound by toggling PORTC.2. 

If the speaker is too loud, cover the hole on top with a piece of tape.  The
speaker may be disconnected from the PIC MCU by cutting the trace on the
back of the board connecting JP3.  PORTC.2 is also shared with the DAC, if
present.

See TONEXU.BAS for a programming example.


RC Servo

Connector J9 may be used to connect an RC servo to LAB-XUSB.  Pin 1, all the
way to the left on the connector (usually the white wire), is the servo
pulse input.  It is connected to PORTA.2.  Pin 2 is +5 volts to the servo
(usually the red wire) and Pin 3 on the connector is ground (usually the
black wire).

Most RC servos are operated by sending a 1ms to 2ms pulse 50 to 60 times a
second.  The pulse width determines the servo position.  A 1.5ms pulse is
the center.  A 1ms pulse is all the way one direction and a 2ms pulse is all
the way the other direction.

The servo pin, PORTA.2 is also shared with the temperature IC, if present.

See SERVOXU.BAS for a programming example.


RS232

The LAB-XUSB includes an RS232 interface to connector J7.  This allows
asynchronous serial communication with other devices, including PCs.  A
MAX232 IC in socket U2, along with several capacitors, generates the
required RS232 voltages.

The serial TX line (pin 2 on J7) is connected to PORTC.6 through the MAX232. 
The serial RX line (pin 3 on J7) is connected to PORTC.7 through the MAX232. 
RTS is connected to CTS (pin 7 to pin 8) on J7.  DTR is connected to DCD and
DSR (pin 1 to 4 to 6) on J7.  These jumped connections make most comm
programs think the LAB-XUSB is online and ready to communicate.

See HSERXU.BAS for a programming example.


Real Time Clock

A Dallas DS1307 real time clock (RTC) may be installed in U5.  The default
PIC MCU connections are I2C serial data (SDA) to PORTA.4 and I2C serial
clock (SCL) to PORTA.5.  Cutting the traces on the back of the board behind
connectors JP5 and JP6 allows connection of the SDA and SCL lines to
alternate pins on the PIC MCU.  Jumpering pins 2 to 3 on each of those
connectors moves SDA to PORTB.0 and SCL to PORTB.1.

A 32.768kHz crystal is also required to be soldered into Y2.  The RTC
requires a specific type of crystal so be sure to check the device specs
before installation.

The RTC will normally run from the LAB-XUSB 5 volt power supply.  Battery
backup power may be provided through connector J10.  Be sure to match the
polarity of the battery and the connector before connecting.

The serial clock and data lines are connected to 4.7k pull-up resistors R9
and R10.  The I2C lines are also shared with the serial EEPROM, if it is
present.

See RTCXU.BAS for programming examples.


Digital to Analog Converter

A Maxim MAX549A 2-channel 8-bit digital to analog converter (DAC) may be
plugged into U6.  It connects with the PIC MCU as follows: !CS to PORTC.0,
SCLK to PORTC.1, and DIN to PORTC.2.  PORTC.2 is also connected to the
speaker.

The 2 outputs of the DAC are brought out to pins 1 and 2 of header J8.  Pin
1 of J8 is closest to the bottom of the LAB-XUSB and pin 3 is ground.

See DACXU.BAS for a programming example.


Temperature

A Dallas DS18S20 1-wire temperature sensor may be soldered into the U3
position on the LAB-XUSB or extended using wires to another location.  A
4.7k resistor must also be soldered into R8.  The 1-wire DQ line is
connected to PORTA.2, which is also shared with the RC servo.

See TEMPXU.BAS for a programming example.

intend to add the header.

See the melabs web site for additional parts and vendor information.



Assembly Instructions

All components must be placed on the top side of the board (the side with the
silk-screened labeling) and soldered from the under side of the board using a
good quality resin-core solder.  While the LAB-XUSB is not difficult to
assemble, some experience with assembling previous projects is desirable.

1. Solder in the resistors.

2. Solder in the IC sockets, with the exception of the 40-pin ZIF socket,
observing polarity.

3. Solder in the push button switches.

4. Solder in the LEDs, observing polarity.

5. Solder in the capacitors, observing polarity where necessary.

6. Solder in the jumpers and headers, including J1 for the LCD module.

7. Solder in the 5-volt regulator, observing polarity (flat heat-sink side
toward center of board).

8. Solder in the DC power connector, USB connector, DB9S connector,
20.000MHz crystal and speaker.

9. Solder in the 40-pin ZIF socket.

10. Solder in the thumbwheel potentiometers.

11. Place jumper on JP2 pins 1 and 2 (bottom 2 pins).

12. Before proceeding, it is a good idea to check the power supply.  Attach
a suitable DC power source to J2.  Measure for 5 volts between +5V and GND
on the pads right below J2.  If 5 volts is not present, recheck all your
work.

13. Place the double-sided foam tape onto the back of the LCD module.  Slide
the LCD module, face up, onto the LCD header, J1, and solder into place from
the top side of the LCD.

14. Install the MAX232 IC, observing polarity.



Test Program

A test program, TESTXU.BAS, has been included to provide a quick operational
test of the LAB-XUSB.  It must be programmed into an appropriate device and
the LAB-XUSB powered up.

The test program will sequentially blink each of the 4 LEDs.  It will also
sound an ascending series of beeps on the speaker.  The top line of the LCD
will display the analog voltage values of the 2 potentiometers, 0 - 255.
The bottom line of the LCD will display the key number of any switch pressed.
If pins 2 and 3 are jumped on the RS232 connector, J7, the second line of
the LCD will also display the word "loopback".
